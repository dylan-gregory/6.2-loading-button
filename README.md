## 6.2 - Loading Button

As I can recall, this was one of the projects that helped me to visualize and understand the concept of asymmetric programming and the power of JavaScript in that. It's simply a button that when clicked fires an AJAX call, and some extra jQuery is used to change the text on the button to "loading.." until the call is returned.
